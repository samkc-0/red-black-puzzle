- [x] there is an index.html that loads graph.js
- [x] graph.js renders a d3 graph with vertices and edges
- [x] server.js serves index.html
- [x] move styles to styles.css
- [x] red/black color and node value is stored on 
- [x] double click on a node to toggle red/black color
- [x] you can see the value of a node in its circle.
- [x] for now, value is the same as id. ie. node is like { id: n, value: n, color: "black" }
- [x] serve static files from public/, since users should not have access to server.js or the filesystem!!!
- [x] text on nodes should now allow any user interaction. I dont want the text to get in the way of double-clicking for red-black color changes.
- [x] click on an edge to delete it
- [x] there is a dashed circle at the top, and when a user drags a node onto it, that node is now officially the root of the red-black tree. Further checks for red-black properties will be based on this node being the root node. Nodes will snap into this circle.
- [x] edges/links are rendered as (directional) arrows, from source to target, instead of simple lines.
- [x] there are unit tests for a function that verifies whether a graph (with lists of nodes and links like in public/graph.js) is a tree or not, starting from a root node specified by id).
- [x] isTree not only returns true/false, but when it returns false, it also returns a reason why the graph is not a tree and the relevant node ids.
- [x] there is an svg ladybug at the bottom of the screen
- [x] the isTree function gives the reason as a reson object that has a code and the detail. there is an enum of the reason codes too. (we want to be able to give the details to users in layman terms later, so they can understand why they are getting the puzzle wrong)
