- [x] there is an index.html that loads graph.js
- [x] graph.js renders a d3 graph with vertices and edges
- [x] server.js serves index.html
- [x] move styles to styles.css
- [x] red/black color and node value is stored on 
- [x] double click on a node to toggle red/black color
- [x] you can see the value of a node in its circle.
- [x] for now, value is the same as id. ie. node is like { id: n, value: n, color: "black" }
- [ ] serve static files from public/, since users should not have access to server.js or the filesystem!!!
- [ ] text on nodes should now allow any user interaction. I dont want the text to get in the way of double-clicking for red-black color changes.
- [ ] click on an edge to delete it
